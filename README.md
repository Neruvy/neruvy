Hello! I am a beginner coder (kind of) thats in middle school.

- **I am in the Gladiator Symphonic Band (Percussion) 🥁**
- **I fork some games into websites ⌨️**
- **I make unblocked games for school 🕹️**
- **I find ways to unblock school chromebooks 💻**

I like to do other activities outside of the technology world and really like science.

"*Life's short and I try to make it enjoyable for myself and other nice people around me.*" - Endermanch (Andrew)
